# The Newton Fractal is the most interesting one in that it can generate a new kind of fractal depending on the
# equation you enter for its main function. I have found that increasing the power of 'z' beyond 4 causes
# division issues.

# Images are stored in the 'src' directory.
#
# All of these fractals are not mine, and I did not make a single one. The code can be found on the following link:
